Class OriginalItems
- Collection of original items stored in a vector or something
- float = 4 bytes
- double = 8 bites


Function: 
getMedians, recalculates the values of each vector entry and returns these in a vector
addItem, adds item to the array (like) vector. 


Class BinaryItem
 - needs the means
 - binaryItem
 - pointer = 8bytes


Class BinaryItems
- #k arrays containing binary items, for each cluster one. 
- #k length array containing the cluster centroids. 
Constructed using originalDB
Construction 
addItem, adds item to the data base.

================
Clustering
- using hamming distance
- lable based on hamming distance

How to retrieve?
-predict cluster
For all items in this cluster, calculate the hamming distance 
Return the list of the top k*c candidates

From this k*c do an intensive search. 

K = the number of vectors we would like to find
C = some constant

Clustering binary data should be avoided according to
